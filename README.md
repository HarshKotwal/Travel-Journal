# 🌍 Travel Journal

A simple React-based travel journal that displays a list of visited destinations with images, descriptions, location tags, and map links.

## Features

- Renders travel card components dynamically using props
- Component-based architecture (Header, Entry, App)
- Clean UI as per the conceptual design
- Responsive layout and image rendering
- Static dataset used to simulate real entries

## Tech Used

- React (Vite)
- JSX components
- CSS module styling

## How It Works

Destination data (title, image, date range, description, etc.) is stored in a local JS file and mapped into reusable `<Entry />` components.

# Current Status
