              The Dolomites in Italy are famous for their breathtaking mountain
              scenery, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and for outdoor
              activities like skiing, hiking, and climbing. They are known for
              their jagged, pale peaks, lush valleys, and turquoise lakes, and
              attract visitors year-round for winter sports and summer
              adventures. The region also features unique cultural aspects, such
              as its blend of Italian and Austrian influences. Some of the
              closest major cities to the Dolomites are Venice, Milan, and
              Verona in Italy, and Innsbruck in Austria.

            <p>
              Lake Pukaki is a large, stunning alpine lake in New Zealand's
              South Island, famous for its vibrant turquoise color and views of
              Aoraki/Mount Cook. The color comes from "glacial flour" finely
              ground rock particles from glaciers that reflect sunlight. It is a
              key part of New Zealand's hydroelectric power system, a cultural
              site for the NgƒÅi Tahu people, and a popular spot for scenic
              drives, photography, hiking, and cycling along parts of the Alps 2
              Ocean Cycle Trail. Lake Pukaki formed when the terminal moraines
              of recording glaciars blocked the valley, forming a moraine-dammed
              lake.

            <p>
              Dunluce Castle is a ruined medieval castle in Northern Ireland,
              perched on a cliff edge in County Antrim. It has a long history,
              with the current ruins dating mainly from the 16th and 17th
              centuries after being built by powerful families like the
              MacQuillans and later the MacDonnells. Visitors can tour the
              ruins, explore archaeological exhibits, and see its location
              featured in shows like <b>Game of Thrones</b>. Dunluce is one of
              the most picturesque and romantic of Irish Castles. It is situated
              on a dramatic basalt rock outcropping that is connected to the
              mainland by a bridge.
